    "review1 = '''\n",
    "I am from OC, and before they opened one in costa mesa, I would come here an unhealthy amount of times. Like everytime I planned a trip to LA, I would make sure I came to Marugame Udon for some delicious beef udon and tempura. I dont know what else to say, but they have the best udon I have ever tried. The egg is literally to die for and the way they crack it in your bowl and you see it just floating on top of your bowl is crazy to me. They put a good amount of meat in your bowl and I just inhale my meal everytime i eat here. You have to add green onions, tempura, and chilli powder to your udon because those toppings are what makes it more flavorful and savory.\n",
    "For parking, you can park in the structure, it is super cheap if you only come to eat for a bit, I usually pay around $2 or something, so its not one of those super expensive LA parking structures. They have more locations now so it is not just the one in Sawtelle. I am so glad there's one in OC and I dont have to drive an hour to get some delicious udon!\n",

    "Throughout my years of college, Marugame is probably the most frequented restaurant, not only on Sawtelle but just generally. This is because it's super convenient. Line moves fast, food comes quick, and is always a solid meal. In my many visits to Marugame, I usually get the Nikutama and I don't really get tired of it. I'm also always a bit worried about trying something new because I've never liked other udons as much as the Nikutama.\n",
    "This time, I tried the curry nikutama. I am not sure why, but the flavor of the curry nikutama was just not what I was expecting. While it wasn't bad, I don't think I would get it again. Their menu is also not very vast, which can be a plus or not depending on what you like.\n",
    "I wish I could give it 5 stars, but I have noticed the pricing increase a lot recently, which is kinda disappointing since we often go to Marugame expecting a cheaper meal. I paid ~$17 for the curry nikutama + a potato croquette.\n",

    "My favorite place to get udon! And maybe even my favorite place to eat at sawtelle. It's usually pretty quick. I love the vibe in the restaurant and how it's cafeteria style. You order your udon and go down picking whatever tempura you want. My favorites are the curry ones, both with and without the beef, although even the non-beef one has some beef in it. I also love the tonkotsu and the plain one too. Depends on the mood. Their chicken karaage is actually super good too!\n",

    "This place was great! I came in on a Sunday at 4:30pm and there was no line and plenty of seating. (When we left around 5:30 the line was out the door).  The way it was set up was similar to a cafeteria line. I ordered the tonkatsu with all the fixings ~green onion and tempura flakes~ along with some tempura mushrooms and shrimp skewers. I also got the ginger berry oolong tea what they make in house.\n",
    "I liked how they had a little bar area for chili, ginger, tempura sauce and water as well as a self serve to-go box/bag area. Since there wasn't any table service, you sat yourselves and brought your finished meals to the cleaning area as well. The bathrooms were also very clean.\n",
    "Moving onto the food, the noodles were very chewy and cooked perfectly. I enjoyed the broth from the tonkatsu since it was really rich to where the noodles soaked up all that flavor. I especially liked the mushroom tempura since they were very juicy. One thing I wish they had was soy sauce since I like my tempura with soy sauce since it has a stronger flavor than the tempura sauce offered, but that is just a personal preference. Overall this place was very good, probably the next udon place I've been to yet.\n",

The noodles were incredibly fresh (tender with the perfect bite!)  and the broth was on point. The regular Kake Udon was the best example of traditional Udon Ive had in a minute! I got the BK udon and added a spring egg- just fantastic.   They constantly making tempura and so the tempura flakes are fresh and really crispy. I truly almost went  back for lunch today- twice in 2 days?? THATS HOW GOOD IT WAS.\n",

    "Love the curry udon although the curry is thick like gravy. Even if there's a long line out the door, the wait isn't that long. It's always clean and they have outdoor seating. One request though, lower tables as the booth like seats are too low for me.\n",

    "Overall a great spot for a warm, low-key meal! My party of 2 came in around 4 PM on a Saturday and experienced no wait time. In the cafeteria-style line, you first order your soup and they assemble it in front of you (with green onions + tempura crunch optional). Once it's done, you take it on your tray and move over to the tempura stations where you use tongs to place individual pieces onto your tray. There are lots of vegetable options (sweet potato, mushroom, pumpkin, etc.) in addition to potato croquettes, shrimp tempura, and tamago tempura. From there, you move to the cashier and select your dipping sauces (tempura, katsu, chili, grated ginger).\n",

    "TONKOTSU UDON:\n",
    "Seriously. So. Delicious. I was a bit skeptical about their udon since I tried the Kitsune Udon previously, and was unimpressed at the lack of flavor. The Tonkotsu Udon, however, blew me away!! The flavorful broth, bouncy noodles, and chashu + miso ground pork worked really well together. The texture is made even better with tempura crunch!\n",

    "SELF-SERVE TEMPURA:\n",
    "I got sweet potato, mushroom (3 per skewer), and Japanese pumpkin. All of these were yummy, with the pumpkin being my favorite! By the time I got there, they had probably been sitting out for a while - so it wasn't as crunchy as I hoped. Still, a great side to the udon - just be careful of getting too much!\n",

    "The broth was very flavorful and the udon noodles were chewy and springy. I loved the addition of the tempura flakes, spicy meat, and green onions. They gave the broth a nice kick and the flakes added texture. The slice of meat was soft and slightly fatty, which is how I like it. My only complaint was that the egg was overly cooked.\n",

There's gotta be a faster or more efficient way to tame that line. Although we did not wait over an hour, I've heard horror stories of such waits. I mean the food is worth checking out, but the long lines may deter people from trying. It did move quickly, but I can see it getting crazyyy.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a cafeteria type of restaurant, soups/bowls first then the sides. Which I think they should switch up... Cause once I sat down the soup wasn't as hot. The sides included: shrimp, squid, chicken & veggies ALL dipped in tempura batter. They did have a chicken katsu type which I didn't get to try. For my bowl I got the Nikatuma which included beef, egg & BK sauce (couldn't tell ya what this is haha) [$10.95- Regular; $12.50-Large] Believe me, that udon was sooo good & filling, I could not finish my regular bowl! The meat reminded me of Yoshina meat- which was always on point- IYKYK! We tried the shrimp, squid & chicken tempura sides and it was also really good, nothing too special about it.\n",

Yes, there will be a next time, just hoping for a shorter line! Lots of seating inside & a few tables on their patio.

They should have had someone out front telling people or a sign instead of making people wait. Everyone in my party is forced to order something that they didn't want because we didn't want to leave after the long wait. The food we ordered (kitsune, tonkotsu, kake) were NOT good.
