### Description about Digital Humanities 140 (dh140)

DH140 is a course at UCLA designed to introduce the language of python and strengthen coding fluency. 
Python will be used in "identifying patterns in literature, recommending new music to your friends, mapping urban inequities, and analyzing social networks."
In this context, python coding will be used in the context of humanities to draw meaningful results that can be impacted in the modern world.

### Project Ideas

A data analysis for humanities at UCLA using data from catalog courses (machine learning), developing realistic situations of historical phenomena

### Objectives for the class

Learn and fluently become proficient in python's libraries while creating interesting and meaningful projects
